# TODO

Work that is decided but not built. `AGENTS.md` and `docs/` describe what
exists; this file is the only place that describes what does not.

Sections are unordered.

Nothing is outstanding. The template below is the shape every entry takes —
leave it here when the file empties, so the next entry has a mould and the
format is not rediscovered from scratch.

## A sentence naming the problem, not the solution

What is wrong today, and what it costs — measured where a measurement exists,
because a number is what tells the reader whether to care. Say what is already
true before saying what should change.

Then the decided shape: what will be built, which library or mechanism, and
what was rejected. A section that leaves the design open gets re-litigated
when it is picked up, which is most of the cost of picking it up.

If the change reverses a stated design, say so here and name the file that
states it — a reversal arriving quietly is worse than the reversal.

```
An example of the thing, if it has a syntax or an output worth showing.

### Read

Where to start, in the order a reader should open things, with `file:line`
anchors for every function the change touches and one clause on why each
matters. This is what lets the work be picked up cold: without anchors the
first hour is spent rediscovering the problem.

Name the files that record a decision the change invalidates — a comment
claiming something that stops being true is a defect the moment it lands.

### Traps

- **The thing that breaks silently.** Why it breaks, and what it looks like
  when it does. Prefer traps that have actually bitten: the ones written from
  experience are the ones that fire.
- **The invariant that must survive.** Not "be careful" — the specific
  property, and what would quietly violate it.
- **The measurement that constrains the design.** A number that rules an
  approach out is worth more than a preference that argues against it.

### Acceptance

- One line per observable behaviour, written so it can be checked rather than
  believed — a command and its outcome, not "works correctly".
- Include the negative cases: what must NOT happen, what must stay unchanged,
  and what must still be refused.
- Finish with the gates: `make test`, `make lint` and `doc-audit` stay clean,
  and any claim this change makes false is corrected in the same commit.
